// Runs the plain SQL migrations in packages/db/migrations. One function, and
// one ledger: the migrate:up and migrate:down scripts call
// scripts/db-migrate.ts, which calls this, so the command line, the test
// harness and the type generator all record into MIGRATIONS_TABLE.
//
// They did not always. The scripts used to call the migration tool's own
// command line, which records into its default table, pgmigrations, while
// this function records into ours. QA measured both tables on one server,
// one per path, which is how a migration gets applied twice or reported as
// pending after it ran. migrate.test.ts fails if the scripts stop going
// through here, or if the other table ever appears.
//
// Migrations run over a session connection, never the transaction pooler:
// the tool takes a session level advisory lock so two runs cannot overlap,
// and a transaction pooler would hand each statement a different backend and
// lose the lock. migrate.test.ts measures both the lock being session held
// and what a second concurrent run does with it.
//
// Two logins run them, because no one login should hold both jobs. The bootstrap
// login creates schemas and administers roles, and needs server wide rights to. The
// migrator does everything else, and takes the owner's rights only for as long as a
// migration needs them. Each file says which it needs, and the runner refuses to run a
// file under the wrong login, so a mistake stops the deploy instead of half applying.
//
// This file imports nothing from its own package. The root scripts load it
// directly under Node's type stripping, which cannot follow a sibling import
// written with a .js specifier.
