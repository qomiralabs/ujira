// Moves money between rows and the core money model, and nothing else.
//
// Out of the database: pg returns numeric and int8 as strings, because a
// JavaScript number cannot hold either exactly, and the type parsers stay as
// pg ships them. The string goes straight into the core constructors, which
// parse it as a bigint and check the range, currency and scale, so a row the
// money model would refuse is refused here rather than carried onwards.
//
// Into the database: the amount travels as the decimal text of its bigint,
// which Postgres reads into numeric exactly. A number never appears on
// either side.
