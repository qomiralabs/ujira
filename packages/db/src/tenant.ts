// The tenant context every query runs under, sent as transaction local
// settings. Two measurements from the Supabase spike shape this file:
//
// - the context statement on its own cost a full network round trip (178 ms
//   p50 from outside the region), so it travels with BEGIN in one statement,
//   which is one round trip;
// - a session level setting was read by another client on the same pooled
//   backend, so every setting here is transaction local and the guard in
//   session-state.ts refuses anything else.
//
// A parameter cannot ride along with BEGIN in a simple query, so the values
// are inlined. They are inlined only after passing a strict check: a value
// that is not exactly a lower case UUID, or one of the two known scopes, is
// refused rather than escaped. Escaping would make a malformed value
// someone else's problem later; refusing it ends there.
//
// The checks take unknown and return the string they read, and the statement
// is built from that return value. A value is therefore read once: an object
// whose string conversion differs between the check and the statement cannot
// pass one and reach the other, which is a hole a type signature alone would
// leave open for an untyped caller.
