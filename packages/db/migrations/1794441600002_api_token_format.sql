-- What the database and the API agree a token is: one to ten scopes from the
-- closed list, and an expiry. The list is the one the API authorizes against, so
-- a change to it is a migration and a change to the API together.

-- Added as NOT VALID, which binds new writes at once and takes no scan. The next
-- two migrations check the rows already there and then make the expiry a real
-- NOT NULL. No route has ever issued a token, so nothing should fail that check;
-- if a row does, the deploy stops there rather than guessing what it should be.
