-- Roles, ownership and grants for schema ujira, the tenant context
-- functions, the row level security template every tenant table applies,
-- and the shared triggers.
--
-- Tenant isolation holds in the database, not only in code: the service
-- roles cannot bypass row level security, every tenant table forces it, and
-- the policies read the tenant from transaction local settings that
-- current_principal_id() refuses to use outside the transaction that set
-- them.
--
-- Roles are shared by every database on the server, so they are created only
-- when missing and the down section never drops them: another database may
-- own objects through them. Their role level timeouts stay too, for the
-- same reason.
--
-- Migrations after this one `set local role ujira_owner` after their
-- timeouts, so what they create is owned by the owner role and not by
-- whoever ran them, and `reset role` at the end of the section, because the
-- runner records the migration in the same transaction as the session user.
