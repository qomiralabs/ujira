-- retries land on, only one insert can win it.

-- A row is either running, holding a lease, or finished, holding the answer. A
-- lease that runs out belongs to a process that died, so a retry of the same
-- request may take over. Finished rows answer for 7 days. After that the row
-- counts as gone, whether or not a retention job has removed it yet.
